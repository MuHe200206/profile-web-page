export const about = `Hi, I'm Kevin! I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and a concentration in Scientific Computation. I'm excited to apply my skills in software development to build practical, user-focused solutions.

I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient code and love working on projects that involve problem-solving, whether it's building web apps, designing backend systems, or experimenting with new tools and technologies. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges that help me grow as a developer.

Currently based in Calgary, I'm exploring opportunities in software development, iOS development, cloud-integrated applications, and full-stack roles. If you'd like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!`
